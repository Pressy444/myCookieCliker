# Preview

- [Live demo]()
# Instructions
To improve our JavaScript skills, we have 5 days to create a cookie clicker game as a team. 
- [Instructions links](https://github.com/becodeorg/Swartz-8/blob/main/2.The-Hill/1.Javascript/cookieClicker.md)

# Languages and frameworks used 
- HTML5, CSS3
- Javascript 

# Wireframe - First draft
We want to make a minimalist yet beautiful layout inspired by the [original game](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) to offer a user-friendly design experience. 

The layout is really simple, with the cookie button and the point on one side, and all the features on the other, so we can have a clear view and not to much information.


Of course, we choose colors that remind us of a cookie and we will try to find fonts and animation that suit that theme.
